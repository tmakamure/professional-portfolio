# Website Creation brief
I need you to create a professional portfolio website for a Senior Software engineer with specialisations in AI Engineering, Sofwtware Development, Cloud -  spcifically AWS and Azure, Data Engineering and Data Analytics. The Engineer's name is "Tinashe Makamure", and it needs to be clear that the portfolio is about him.

The portfolio must highlight his special skill set. To assist with this I have also added a "CV_Tinashe_Makamure__Software_Engineer.pdf", which is his most up to date resume.

The site needs to be slick, morden, and mus inspire confidence in prospective customers.
## Website Sections
- The website must have a clean and slick, morden hero section that clearly sets the the theme of the page and what its about. You can utilize either "bold-hero.png" or "hero-alternative.png" as your hero section images, preferrably "hero-alternative.png" but you are free to do either or -  be creative
- The website should have a short bio section about the Engineer in question, this can be found in the resume document "CV_Tinashe_Makamure__Software_Engineer.pdf". If you must or you wish to have an image in this section of the website, you can utilize the image "mid-hero.png"
- The website must then highlight the major skillset as defined in this brief and the resume document "CV_Tinashe_Makamure__Software_Engineer.pdf"
- The Website should have a contact form towards the bottom of the page for those who want to collaborate with the engineer. You can use the "footer-hero-gaze.png" picture next to the form or behind it or whatever makes the most sense to make the site look slick and mordern.
- The website must also have, preferrably as a seperate page, a resume page, where people can view the resume as a timeline. For this you may use the information in the resume document to construct a new resume page in react that is consistent with the theme of the page
- The website must also have a blog section, preferrably its own page, where people can see published blogs, this section should be able to render markdown files. In a future iteration we will look into how to deliver the markdown files that must be rendered as blogs, for now the section must exist, maybe with a coming soon message
- The website must have a means to view projects completed in the past
- For the colors, you may utilize: `#050915`, white, off-white, and some gold.

## Tech stack:
- NextJS with typescript support and tailwind support, and if required, SQLite

## Additional information
- Note that the site will be hosted on an S3 bucket in aws sitting behing a cloud front distribution
